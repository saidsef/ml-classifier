Benchmark journals and large audit groups engage in a sort of classification to evaluate companies, the most profitable in the world, the most richest and so on. The 2018 winners will be announced withins days. But let us spend a little time on the 2017 charts of auditing firm Price Waterhouse Coopers (PwC).\n\n Relative to market capitalization, considered the market value of a publicly traded company, in 2017 according to Price Waterhouse Coopers (PwC).\n\n Image 1 CAPITALIZATION\n\n Let\u2019s look at this picture together and realise that the top 5 is dominated by American companies whose main resource is human intelligence.\n\n Apple\n\n Alphabet (formerly google)\n\n Amazon.com (which also deals with the distribution of goods and services among others)\n\n Berkshire Hathaway (Finance)\n\n Facebook\n\n These companies sell phones, computers, software, promote the link, communication between individuals.\nThere are no mining or oil companies in the top 5.\n\n The list is dominated completely by knowledge-based companies, the imagined and  virtual.\n\n For Algerian intelligence specialist Idriss Aberkane, the brain is about to supplant natural resources to become the true wealth of societies that still want to count on the contemporary world.\n\n \u201cI would like to remind you that the natural resources of a nation is not the key to its economic growth.When we observe South Korea carefully, it exports more than Russia.\nSouth Korea is a very small country compared to Russia but today South Korea is very rich . It exports more than Russia, while Russia has natural gas and oil (. ..) Despite that, South Korea exports more than Russia. Because it exports its intelligence, It sells us Samsung, LG hard drives, software. But in the 1950\u2019S AND 60\u2019s, they were not good in these areas.They developed very late so it is important to note that knowledge represents more wealth than oil and other resources and those who sell knowledge are richer than those who sell natural resources\u201d.\n\n Interesting isn\u2019t it! Even Fortune magazine\u2019s 2017 record confirms the dominance of the knowledge-based economy.\nFor the 6th year running, Apple has been ranked as the most profitable company in the world. It\u2019s net profit for 2016 was over $ 45.6 billion dollars. A figure which is very amazing for us Africans.  Apple\u2019s profit is 78 times the budget of Nigeria in 2017.  According to the African Development Bank (ADB),  Nigeria is the richest country in Africa based on their Gross Domestic Product (GDP) figures.\n\n IMAGE 2\n\n We are fortunate in Africa that thanks to ICT, we can make a qualitative leap and play on equal terms with the major industrialised nations.\nThe right environment must be created: \u2013 invest in infrastructure \u2013  fiber optic cables \u2013 implement significant legislations \u2013 encourage and support start-ups who need to financial assistance to grow.\n\n  @maemble", "language": "English", "source": "AfricaNews", "link": "http://www.africanews.com/2018/07/04/the-value-of-knowledge-based-economy/", "date": "2018-07-04T10:49:20.000Z", "categories": "News", "subject": "The value of knowledge-based economy"}, {"body": "[Ghanaian Times] HBD, the tourism development company, says it will continue to invest in hotel and tourism facilities on the island of Sao Tome and Principe to help preserve and enhance the ecosystem of the surrounding waters and islets.", "language": "English", "source": "AllAfrica", "link": "http://allafrica.com/stories/201807040486.html", "date": "2018-07-04T10:47:58.000Z", "categories": "News", "subject": "Cape Verde:HBD Invests Close to 17-Million Euro in Sundy Praia - General Manager"}, {"body": "[The Herald] Local businesses should scale up consumer relations etiquette or risk losing out on the expected influx of foreign businesses that are showing increased interest in investing in Zimbabwe, the Chartered Institute of Customer Relations Management (CICRM) has warned.", "language": "English", "source": "AllAfrica", "link": "http://allafrica.com/stories/201807040473.html", "date": "2018-07-04T10:44:38.000Z", "categories": "News", "subject": "Zimbabwe:Local Business Warned"}, {"body": "[The Herald] Presidential hopeful Mrs Violet Mariyacha, leader of the United Democracy Movement (UDM), has said if given the mandate to govern, her party's main focus would be to inject enough cash into the economy to clear bank queues within three weeks.", "language": "English", "source": "AllAfrica", "link": "http://allafrica.com/stories/201807040470.html", "date": "2018-07-04T10:44:33.000Z", "categories": "News", "subject": "Zimbabwe:I'll Clear Bank Queues in 3 Weeks, Says Presidential Hopeful Mariyacha"}, {"body": "[The Herald] NMB Bank has secured a $15 million line of credit facility for exporters as part of its efforts to enhance exports that are the country's biggest foreign currency earner.", "language": "English", "source": "AllAfrica", "link": "http://allafrica.com/stories/201807040467.html", "date": "2018-07-04T10:44:27.000Z", "categories": "News", "subject": "Zimbabwe:U.S.$15 Million Credit Facility for Exporters"}, {"body": "[The Herald] The $4,2 billion platinum investment project in Mhondoro-Ngezi has become one of the fastest projects to be implemented under President Mnangagwa's administration, with the investor -- Karo Resources of Cyprus -- having already moved mining equipment on site, only three months after the deal was signed.", "language": "English", "source": "AllAfrica", "link": "http://allafrica.com/stories/201807040433.html", "date": "2018-07-04T10:30:38.000Z", "categories": "News", "subject": "Zimbabwe:U.S.$4,2 Billion Project Ready for Takeoff"}, {"body": "[The Herald] The dairy sector is set for a massive revitalisation after Government launched the National Command Dairy programme at Sangano Cooperative Dairy in Makoni last week.", "language": "English", "source": "AllAfrica", "link": "http://allafrica.com/stories/201807040429.html", "date": "2018-07-04T10:30:06.000Z", "categories": "News", "subject": "Zimbabwe:Govt Launches Command Dairy"}, {"body": "[Foroyaa] Dr Njogu Bah, former Secretary-General and Head of Civil Services in the former regime of Yaya Jammeh, Wednesday June 27th 2018, reappeared before the 'Janneh' Commission and told Commissioners that he was not the desk officer for Gam Petroleum Company, at the Office of the former President.", "language": "English", "source": "AllAfrica", "link": "http://allafrica.com/stories/201807040427.html", "date": "2018-07-04T10:27:56.000Z", "categories": "News", "subject": "Gambia:At the 'Janneh' Commission - Dr. Njogu Bah Said He Was Not Desk Officer for Gam Petroleum"}, {"body": "[Foroyaa] The National Assembly (NA) Select Committee on Agriculture, presented its report before Deputies, after the former's visit to sectors under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Agriculture.

This is one of the latest concerns raised by Kaspersky Lab, which has found that people are leaving their devices \u2013 and the increasing amount of precious data on them \u2013 accessible to anyone. Many people today rely on their mobile devices to access the Internet and carry out online activities, so losing a device to petty crime is potentially more damaging and upsetting than ever before. For example, 75% of individuals surveyed in the UAE say they regularly use the Internet on a smartphone and 36% now regularly use a tablet to get online. As such, several types of precious data are being stored on, and sent from, these gadgets. For example, over a third (41%) of people use their smartphone for online banking, which of course provides access to valuable financial information. Furthermore, 65% of people regularly use their smartphone for accessing their personal email accounts and 66% say they use it for social media activities, both of which involve a huge quantity of sensitive data. But having a lot of precious data on their mobile devices doesn\u2019t necessarily make people conscious and secure \u2013 only (53%) of people password-protect their mobile devices and just 14% of people encrypt their files and folders to avoid unauthorised access. So, if these devices fall into the wrong hands, all of this data \u2013 from personal accounts, to photos, messages and even financial details \u2013 could become accessible to someone else. Even losing devices that are protected with passwords can still have significant consequences. For example, less than half (46%) of people make backups of their data and only 47% use anti-theft features on their mobile devices, meaning that these devices\u2019 ex-owners will likely experience a lack of access to their own personal information and accounts as a result. Dmitry Aleshin, VP for Product Marketing, Kaspersky Lab said, \u201cWe all love our connected devices because they give us access to vital information, from anywhere at any time. They are valuable items that criminals naturally want to get their hands on, and their job is made easier by the fact that every other pickpocketed phone is not password protected. There are a few really simple things that everyone can do to secure their devices and the data they hold. By applying password protection and using a dedicated security solution, including anti-theft protection, you can protect your personal information, photos and online accounts from both loss and malicious usage.\u201d Kaspersky Internet Security for Android is designed to help individuals protect their mobile devices. It urges users to password protect their devices, successfully securing them against both online and offline threats \u2013 be it theft, malware or the prying eyes of strangers.

As pointed out on many occasions, this is not driven by concerns of \u201cgrave human rights violations\u201d. The over-arching political objective of the principal architects has always been to villify, destabilize and isolate Eritrea and human right mechanisms have been misused as an extension of regional conflict. \r\n It is unfortunate that the Council is discussing the final but unwarranted and recycled report of the SR. The lack of objectivity and professionalism is again manifested in the unsubstantiated allegations, denial of Eritrea\u2019s achievements and the myths of \u201cno tangible progress, continued concern, lack of genuine commitment, etc.\u201d. Once again, the goal is to recommend unwarranted extreme measures or at least sustain the harassment and confrontation by extending the counterproductive mandate. \r\n Consequently, Eritrea\u2019s ground reality continues to be negated in the Report at hand in violation of the UN principle of interlink between peace and security and human right and development. The mandate deliberately fails to appraise the Council on concrete progress that includes the promotion of equal rights and opportunities sanctioned by national law, equitable distribution of resources and wealth, responsible popular participation in governance, and unity and diversity reflected in societal harmony. The attendant exemplary peace and stability earned through sustained effort, resilience and sacrifice that endure advances in human dignity, betterment and development of all Eritreans is again misjudged in the Report. \r\n Mr President \r\n Eritrea recognizes that it still faces, like many other nations, institutional challenges in consolidating a robust framework of human rights. In this respect, it has both reviewed its domestic legal architecture of laws and regulations (enshrined in the revised Civil, Penal and Commercial Codes) and also signed and implements almost all core regional and international conventions on human rights. \r\n Stemming from its holistic approach on the indivisibility and universality of human rights, it has gone further to incorporate and implements basic social human rights in its laws and strategic developmental plans. This has accelerated socio-economic progress, consolidated the rule of law and strengthened national institutions. The commendable achievements, including in most of the MDGs parameters, widely recognized by United Nations and other development partners offer a glimpse of the true narrative on progress in spite of considerable economic and national security challenges that it has been facing for almost 20 years now. \r\n Eritrea has and continues to undertake tangible action to engage with its regional and international partners. It is indeed engaged, in good faith, in the Universal Periodic Review and is preparing the third cycle National report. It maintains that this is a fair and viable mechanism for experience sharing, emulation of best practices, as well as an appropriate mechanism for engagement. The initial and Combined Report on African Charter for Human and People\u2019s Rights (ACHPR) was also discussed in the 62nd Session of ACHPR. \r\n Mr President \r\n As the mandate ends in the present 38th session, the Council knows well that the aforesaid confrontational approach of the last six years has not created any dividend. The destructive intentions harbored under the rubric of \u201chuman rights violations\u201d are also exposed.

In a multi-year agreement, Juniper will work closely with WRO to promote, stage and further develop this global competition that attracts tens of thousands of young people. \u201cIt is imperative that the upcoming generations understand the importance of automation &#8211; Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, virtualization \u2013 in order to take technology forward into their future. Juniper Networks is proud to be the global technology partner of the WRO Finals in 2018 and beyond, as it is the perfect nurturing environment for tomorrow\u2019s automation innovators.\u201d said\u00a0Mike Marcellin, chief marketing officer at Juniper Networks. As part of its involvement in the competition, Juniper will be sponsoring a new trophy at this year\u2019s finals, WRO 2018, known as the Juniper Networks\u2019 Engineering Simplicity Honors Award. Juniper will judge teams in the Regular category at the finals, across all age groups, on the boldness, creativity and simplicity of their robot-led solutions. Overall, the WRO competition encourages participating teams to solve challenges and complex problems using mathematics, computer programming and coding skills, as well as exploring the principles of automation. It also fosters other important life skills including teamwork, perseverance, learning from mistakes and creative thinking. Each year, at least 23,000 teams from more than 70 countries take part in WRO\u2019s competition. This involves approximately 100,000 young people, ranging from six to 25 years old. The competition comprises several categories across the age group span, including Regular (a themed category), Open (to drive innovation and creativity), a robotic football tournament, an Advanced Robotics Challenge for students aged 19-25, and WeDo, a starter class for children aged 6-10. The competition focuses on a specific theme that is relevant to a prevailing global issue \u2013 this year it is Food Matters. Challenges are tailored specifically to the theme, enabling competitors to develop ambitious, yet simple, automated solutions. WRO, founded in 2004, hosts the Finals in a different country each year. In 2018, the global finals will be in Chiang Mai, Thailand (November 16-18) and they will take place in Hungary in 2019. \u201cIn WRO, we see robotics as a wonderful platform for giving young people around the world an opportunity to be hands-on with STEM. We see the teams adopt new technology when developing fully autonomous robots and they apply engineering processes when designing prototypes before completing the challenges. They quickly get absorbed in coming up with original solutions to complex problems,&#8221;\u00a0said Claus Ditlev Christensen, secretary-general at World Robot Olympiad Association Ltd. \u201cBringing Juniper Networks on board as a global premium partner enables us to tap into its heritage and experience as an engineering and automation pioneer.

These events cannot but imbue additional significance to Martyrs Day that we are commemorating today.    \r\n The Eritrean people, but also the Ethiopian people, have lost an opportunity of two generations for over half a century due to policies designed to promote external global agendas.   When they achieved their respective liberations in 1991 through a common struggle, they embarked, with earnestness, on a new chapter.   This was prompted by the desire to advance their complimentary bilateral interests as well as to enhance collective growth in the entire Horn of Africa region.   Unfortunately, this promising beginning was rolled back by the resurgence of misguided global policies.   The devastations, sacrifices and loss of opportunities that ensued were very heavy indeed. \r\n The philosophical global order that the previous three US Administrations enunciated \u2013 in the aftermath of the abrupt collapse of the former Soviet Union -   entailed huge economic losses to the United States worth trillions of dollars in the last 25 years.   The decline is much graver when seen through the prism of soft power and influence.    The imbalance and destruction that it wrought in our region has also been substantial.   The Trump Administration, which has been in Office for the past year and a half, is essentially the byproduct or outcome of past failures. As such, it has been sending various signals that attest to its desire to change the defunct policies behind those losses.      The resistance that it is confronting, above and beyond campaigns of disparagement, has not been negligible.   Although it may still be premature to accurately gauge its ultimate intentions and capabilities, we shall continue to work together with our partners, in accordance with our policy choice of active engagement and without any reservations and prejudgment, to prompt the current US Administration to rectify previous misguided polices in our region.       \r\n Ladies and Gentlemen, \r\n The events and developments that have unfolded in our region in general and in Ethiopia in particular in the recent period warrant appropriate attention.   Needless to stress, it is the Ethiopian people \u2013 forced as they were into adversarial ties of vertical polarization - who were the primary victims, and who have borne the main brunt, of the destructive policies of the TPLF regime and its paymasters.       The second, relatively bigger loss, stemmed from the TPLF\u2019s ability to derail and frustrate the positive bilateral and regional all-rounded growth that could have been achieved through the complimentary resources and capabilities of the Ethiopian and Eritrean peoples.   Twenty seven years is a long interval.   The losses incurred and time wasted are thus huge in terms of this yardstick.    \r\n But as the damage inculcated on the Ethiopian people became increasingly unbearable, it spurred the wrath and a rebellion in the people who said \u201cenough is enough\u201d.   This in turn precipitated the end of the TPLF\u2019s shenanigans; which was aptly described as \u201cGame Over\u201d.   Ethiopia is now at a turning point or transition.   What is the destination?   How will this be achieved?   These are timely questions that must be raised.   But although it will require time and efforts to remove the TPLF\u2019s toxic and malignant legacy and to bring about a congenial climate, the positive direction that has been set in motion is crystal clear. \r\n The TPLF clique, and other vultures, are dumbfounded by the ongoing changes.   And, as they know full well that their game has come to an end, they will not refrain from concocting various machinations to obstruct any change and to mollify their wayward appetite.   One of the worn-out tricks that they will try to wield to prolong their dwindling power and to impede positive change is to work for the perpetuation of tension with Eritrea and to preserve the illicit sanctions.   This is best illustrated by their ambivalent public pronouncements of \u201cyes\u2026but\u201d in these past days.   This is designed to prevent a durable solution to the senseless border conflict that they unleashed in the first place without any justification.   But their principal preoccupation and ill-will is to avert and frustrate any positive change in Ethiopia. \r\n As it is the case with Eritrea, the people of Ethiopia also relish peace and harmony with their neighbor.   There is nothing novel in this fact. The positive signals issued in these past days can be seen as an expression of this popular choice.   The complimetarity of both peoples and countries, their common bilateral interests and prosperity, are sacrosanct objectives to which we have toiled and paid sacrifices for two generations.   As such, it remains a priority for which we will be actively engaged.   For this reason, and outside myopic considerations of public relations   stunts and advantages, we will send a delegation to Addis Abeba to gauge current developments directly and in depth as well as to chart out a plan for continuous future action. \r\n Ladies and Gentlemen,    \r\n Our assessments of global and regional realities and trends have significant impact on the policies we formulate; and especially on our domestic cohesion and power; and, the economic growth and prosperity of our country to which we attach paramount importance and priority.   In this perspective, it is natural that we see our various sectoral developmental programmes in relation to our neighbours in general and with Ethiopia in particular.   The precious sacrifices that we have paid both during the struggle for liberation and later to protect our sovereignty were driven by these objectives.   Our commitment to advance these objectives now with great vigour is a tribute to our Martyrs. \r\n \u00a0 \r\n Glory to our heroic Martyrs! \r\n Victory to the Masses!", "language": "English", "source": "Shabait", "link": "http://www.shabait.com/news/local-news/26520-president-isaias-speech-on-martyrs-day", "date": "2018-06-20T07:39:00.000Z", "categories": "frontpage", "subject": "President Isaias' Speech on Martyrs Day"}, {"body": "NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg voiced confidence June 19 that Alliance members will demonstrate unity at a summit next month despite \"important differences\" between the United States and European members of the transatlantic Alliance.", "language": "English", "source": "Hurriyet", "link": "http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/nato-will-show-unity-despite-differences-stoltenberg-133516", "date": "2018-06-20T07:32:45.000Z", "categories": "World", "subject": "NATO will show unity despite differences: Stoltenberg"}, {"body": "Prayer services in memory of martyrs who paid their lives during the  struggle for independence and safeguarding national sovereignty were  conducted yesterday at the Saint Michael Church and Khalid bin-Welid  Mosque here in the capital. \r\n\r\n  Asmara, 20 June 2018 - Prayer services in memory of martyrs who paid their lives during the struggle for independence and safeguarding national sovereignty were conducted yesterday at the Saint Michael Church and Khalid bin-Welid Mosque here in the capital.

It seems that tricksters on Google Play have found another way to make their deceptive apps appear more trustworthy to users \u2013 that is, at least at first sight. The trick takes advantage of the fact that apart from app icon and name, there is one more element the user sees when browsing apps \u2013 the developer name, displayed just below the app name. And since unknown developer names are no use for popularity-boosting purposes anyway, some app authors have been setting fictitious, high numbers of installs as their developer names, in an effort to look like established developers with vast userbases. We have discovered hundreds of apps using this and similar tricks to deceive users. The apps we\u2019ve analyzed were either misleading users about their functionality or had no functionality at all, yet most display many advertisements. The freedom to set any number of choice as developer name has inspired some remarkably ambitious claims \u2013 one game developer, for instance, would like users to believe his games have been installed more than five billion times. (Note: the highest-ranking apps in terms of number of installs fall into the category \u201c1,000,000,000+\u201d at the time of writing; this category includes Google Play itself, Gmail, Facebook, WhatsApp, Skype, etc.) In one particular case, we saw a developer change his name from a fake installation number to an actual developer name over time, which might indicate the trick is used as a temporary measure aimed at boosting the popularity of newly uploaded apps. Besides using fake installation numbers to attempt to manipulate users into downloading their apps, some app authors have also been using phrases indicating legitimacy, such as \u201cLegit Apps\u201d, \u201cVerified Applications\u201d, and \u201cTrusted Developers App\u201d. Some also incorporate a check mark symbol, similar to those used as \u201cverified\u201d badges for the accounts of well-known personalities and brands on various social media sites. These are variously included in app icons and names, as well as in developer names. As Google Play probably does not offer a developer account verification service, any app sporting such a tag should necessarily be considered suspicious. How to stay safe The tricks described in this article are simple, yet potentially effective, ways to mislead users, particularly those who choose apps based on popularity. While none of these apps were outright malicious, these techniques could easily be misused by malware authors in the future. Fortunately, the tricks are also simple to spot, if you know what to focus on: Make sure to only take the number of installations for each app from the app\u2019s Google Play page, as this is the official number. This will be visible in the \u201cAdditional Information\u201d section at the bottom of the page. Keep in mind that Google Play does not have a \u201cVerified\u201d badge signifying the legitimacy of apps. It does have the \u201cEditor\u2019s Choice\u201d category, marked by the Editor\u2019s Choice badge in the top right corner of the app\u2019s Google Play page. Make sure you read user reviews before downloading any app. If an app only has a small number of real installs, and/or was only released within the last few days, leave it for others to be the guinea pigs no matter how much you think you want it.

These datasets, if misused, allow the user\u2019s activities to be monitored, including the entering of sensitive information. These findings are part of the analysis about the impact that the proliferation of IoT can have on the daily lives of users and their information security. In recent years, the cyber security industry has shown that private user data is becoming a very valuable commodity, due to almost limitless criminal uses \u2013 from sophisticated digital profiling of cybercriminals\u2019 victims, to market predictions on user behavior. But while consumer paranoia over personal information misuse is growing, with many turning their attentions to online platforms and data collection methods, other \u2013 less obvious \u2013 threat sources remain unprotected. For instance, to help maintain a healthy lifestyle, many of us use fitness trackers to monitor exercise and sport activities. But this could have dangerous consequences. Smart wearable devices, including smartwatches and fitness trackers, are commonly used in sporting activities, to monitor our health and receive push notifications etc. To carry out their main functions, most of these devices are equipped with built-in acceleration sensors (accelerometers), which are often combined with rotation sensors (gyroscopes) for step counting and identifying the user\u2019s current position. Kaspersky Lab experts decided to examine what user information these sensors could provide to unauthorized third parties, and took a closer look at several smartwatches from a number of vendors. To examine the issue, experts developed a fairly simple smartwatch application that recorded signals from built-in accelerometers and gyroscopes. The recorded data was then saved either into the wearable device\u2019s memory or uploaded to the Bluetooth-paired mobile phone. Using mathematical algorithms available to the smart wearable\u2019s computing power, it was possible to identify behavioral patterns, periods of time when and where users were moving, and how long they were doing it. Most importantly, it was possible to identify sensitive user activities, including entering a passphrase on the computer (with accuracy of up to 96%), entering a PIN code at the ATM (approximately 87%) and unlocking the mobile phone (approximately 64%). The signal dataset itself is a behavioral pattern unique to the device owner. Using this, a third party could go further and try to identify a user\u2019s identity \u2013 either through an email address that was requested at registration stage in the app or via turned on access to Android account credentials. After that, it is just a matter of time until a victim\u2019s detailed information is identified, including their daily routines and moments when they are entering important data. And given the growing price for users\u2019 private data, we could fast find ourselves in a world where third parties monetize this vector. But even if this exploit is not capitalized on, but used instead by cybercriminals for their own malicious purposes, the possible consequences are limited only by their imagination and level of technical knowledge. For instance, they could decrypt the received signals using neural networks, waylay victims, or install skimmers at their favorite ATMs. We have already seem how criminals can achieve 80% accuracy when trying to decrypt accelerometer signals and identify the password or PIN using only the data collected from smartwatch sensors. \u201cSmart wearables are not just miniature gadgets, they are cyber-physical systems that can record, store and process physical parameters. Our research shows that even very simple algorithms, being run on the smartwatch itself, are able to capture the unique user\u2019s profile of accelerometer and gyroscope signals. These profiles can then be used to deanonymize the user and track his or her activities, including the moments when entering sensitive information. And this can be done via legitimate smartwatch apps that covertly send signal data to third parties,\u201d said Sergey Lurye, a security enthusiast and co-author of the research at Kaspersky Lab. Kaspersky Lab researchers advise users to pay attention to the following peculiarities when wearing smart devices: 1) If the application sends a request to retrieve user account information, this is a cause for concern &#8211; because criminals could easily build a \u201cdigital fingerprint\u201d of its owner. 2) If the application also requests permission to send geolocation data, then you should worry. Do not give fitness trackers that you download on your smartwatch, extra permissions or set your corporate e-mail address as the login. 3) Fast battery consumption of the device can also be a serious cause for concern. If your gadget runs dry within just a few hours instead of a day, you should check what it\u2019s actually doing. It might be writing signal logs, or worse, sending them elsewhere.

And, if they do have to delete files, 27 per cent of UAE users would delete a photo of themselves before that of friends, pets or family. The research, which looked at people\u2019s experiences with storage on smartphones, also found that 64 per cent of people have to delete files or data from their main handsets in order to free up space at least once a month, while three quarters do this at least once every three months. Khwaja Saifuddin, Senior Sales Director, Middle East at WDC, said: \u201cOur research really highlights the pressure that people are under to choose what they want to keep on their smartphones. With the average person in the UAE taking 34 photos and 18 videos a week on their smartphone, and the size of digital images and video increasing rapidly,\u00a0devices soon fill up.\u201d In addition to the challenges around storage, the research also looked at security, with 61 per cent of respondents being worried that the files and data on their smartphone are at risk of theft or loss through product malfunction, and 58 per cent said they had lost a precious photo or video from their smartphone as a result of files not being backed up. Despite this, only 37 per cent of users in the UAE manually back up the files and data on their main smartphone at least once a week and 61 per cent do so at least once a month; seven per cent never back up files at all, excluding automatic backups and data synchs. Added, Saifuddin: \u201cWhat many people don\u2019t realise is that there are all sorts of ways to quickly and easily transfer and store data from smartphones \u2013 either by connecting a device to the handset or using Wi-Fi \u2013 so you don\u2019t have to choose what you delete. In addition, backing up your smartphone remotely also means that you keep precious files safe, should anything happen to the handset.\u201d With the digital revolution under way and an unprecedented explosion of data, the landscape for storage devices has changed rapidly and WDC has stepped up to meet this demand.

The \u201cCold \u2013War period\u201d, that span for fifty years from the end of the Second World War until our independence, was characterized by a bi-polar world order.\u00a0 The chronological developments and features of this period are recorded in our documents and history.\u00a0 The end of the bi-polar world order \u2013 that coincidentally occurred in the same year of our independence \u2013 ushered in a uni-polar world order.\u00a0   The upheavals and devastation inculcated in the past twenty five years are fresh in our memories.\u00a0 This is indeed a matter of yesterday\u2019s recorded history.\u00a0\u00a0 All the indications are that this \u201cuni-polar\u201d world order will not have the predicted longevity.\u00a0 The turbulences that we are witnessing in global dynamics today can in fact be interpreted as the symptoms of a transitional phase.\u00a0   Where will this transitional phase end up? How much time will it take? Some analysts postulate that the end result will be a multi-polar world order.\u00a0 If so, who will be the principal protagonists in the new, global architecture?\u00a0 The United States?\u00a0 China?\u00a0 Russia?\u00a0 India?\u00a0 Europe?\u00a0\u00a0 What are the potential permutations? What will be the balance of power? What will be the underlying value system?\u00a0 And how will this affect and influence our region?\u00a0 These scenarios cannot but provoke a host of questions.  We cannot be nostalgic of the bi-polar world order for very palpable reasons.\u00a0 The indelible fact is we were compelled to pay a hefty price in the period that it lasted.\u00a0 Nor can we have any love lost to the uni-polar world order of yesterday.\u00a0 This was, again, a time when our sovereignty was threatened while an unfair and illicit sanctions regime was also imposed on us.\u00a0   We do not have cogent reasons to cherish a multi-polar world order.\u00a0 Bi-polar, uni-polar or multi-polar global security architectures are not critical factors in themselves or in abstract terms.\u00a0 The crucial issue transcends mere numerical configurations.\u00a0 The fundamental wishes of the peoples of the world; what is determinant at the end of the day, is a global order that is rooted on justice and the respect of the sovereignty of nations; a global order that is free from the rule of the jungle dominated by a greedy few.  The damages inculcated on us in the past 75 years by \u201cmajor global powers\u201d, \u201cregional hegemons\u201d and \u201csurrogates\u201d to advance their perceived agendas and power games are fresh in our minds.\u00a0 In the event, we need to meticulously gauge future scenarios and emergent agendas (and the possible permutations) that will ensue thereof.\u00a0 The road map of our national trajectory will have to be charted out taking these factors into account.\u00a0 In all eventualities, we will not act as mere onlookers with folded hands.\u00a0 We shall continue to strengthen our readiness for active engagement without any bias.  Ladies and Gentlemen,  Although we recognize the influence of global and regional developments \u2013 irrespective of scale \u2013 in our national development, the principal and determinant factor is nonetheless our domestic reality and its robustness.\u00a0   The extraordinary achievements of the liberation struggle have been repeated and reinforced in the past 25 years of unremitting hostilities.\u00a0 We have confronted the myriad tentacles of adversity with patience, resilience and strong defiance.\u00a0 We have not capitulated.\u00a0 The antagonisms unleashed against us have lost their steam to dissipate into oblivion.\u00a0 The opportunities that stand before us today are substantial.\u00a0 We must accordingly brace ourselves physically and mentally to implement robust programmes of our developmental objectives with more vigorous power and greater pace.\u00a0 This is not an option; it is a necessity.  Ladies and Gentlemen,  The programmes and projects that we have been pursuing \u2013 under the existing circumstances and opportunities \u2013 will naturally require further review and refinement for optimal implementation.\u00a0 And they can be summarized as:   o\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The strategy of harnessing and harvesting rainfall.\u00a0 This involves building the necessary water infrastructure through even spatial distribution and in a phased manner in order to ensure optimal utilization of our water, land and climatic resources and endowments with the ultimate aim of increasing agricultural production both in quantitative and qualitative terms through the introduction of modern technology.\u00a0   o\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In marine resources, to pursue a similar strategy to build the requisite infrastructure in order to increase our domestic productive capacity;  o\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To funnel investment and more vigorous work to the energy sector so as to implement, in a modular manner, our planned schemes of revamping power generation and supply through the right mix of policy choices (thermal, solar, wind and other modalities of alternative energy).\u00a0\u00a0 This is critical and indispensable for strengthening our developmental programmes in several sectors and especially for embarking on manufacturing and industrialization, due to its obvious strategic importance, at a fast pace.\u00a0   o\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To increase investment in order to upgrade our domestic resources and capacity for the effective implementation of our\u00a0 programmes of physical infrastructure; (roads, ports, harbours, airports as well as housing projects that are being implemented at a slow pace);  o\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To increase public transport both in quality and quantity;  o\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To pursue the ongoing fiscal and monetary restructuring through more robust and qualitative administrative and managerial inputs;  o\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To enhance effective and efficient administrative competences by further reviewing and strengthening efforts already underway to address weakness and corrupt practices at various levels of administration;  o\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To increase integrated investment in our educational system \u2013 in terms of curriculum and supportive instruments, teachers/experts, infrastructure and other vital facilities \u2013 so as to augment our human capital and its multiplier dimensions through special attention and highest priority;  o\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To review already charted-out programmes and plans of action to encourage and ensure the participation and contribution of all Eritreans who reside abroad in all our developmental programmes;  These are the main priorities of the coming three to five years.

According to the company, the Honor 10 handset brings to life the concept of artificial intelligence (AI) and two major ground-breaking technologies to consumers.\u00a0The first according to Honor is the advanced AI 2.0 technology, applied chiefly to the smartphone&#8217;s dual-lens camera. Second is the Honor 10 CMFdesign, a 3D glass back with a stunning nano-scale optical coating composed of 15 layers of shimmering color. The Honor 10 has a 5.84in Full HD display with a 19:9 screen ratio and 24MP + 16MP rear camera setup that is powered by a built-in NPU. The front facing camera has a massive 24MP sensor and AI, with support for 3D facial recognition.\u00a0The UAE version sports a 4GB of RAM/128GB of storage and 3,400mAh battery with Honor\u2019s Super Charge supported. Chris Sun Baigong, Vice President, Honor Middle East and Africa, said, &#8220;Before 2016, most phones came in just three colours: black, white and gold. Honor introduced phantom blue in 2016, phantom grey in 2017 and now the exquisite Aurora, a true breakthrough in smartphone design.&#8221; &#8220;We believe the recipe of success is simple &#8211; give consumers a really good product. That&#8217;s what we work hard for everyday at Honor. But we don&#8217;t just stop at making a good product. We want to co-create a new lifestyle with young people worldwide. We listen to them, we bounce ideas around with them, and we cheer for them. They are our inspiration,&#8221; he added. With the innovative devices and a precise targeting strategy, Honor continues to lead the industry in its home market as the number one smartphone e-brand in China, while expanding rapidly overseas. Todate, the brand has achieved 100% growth in overseas markets since its inception. The Honor 10 will be available in the UAE from 22nd\u00a0May at a retail price of AED1699 in retail stores and Honor&#8217;s UAE website. \n The post  AI-powered Honor 10 launches in UAE  appeared

Equipped with a 6.1-inch bright display and rated IP68 for dust and water resistance, the LG G7 ThinQ\u00a0is designed to meet the requirements of harsh environments. The LG G7 ThinQ has been upgraded with an 8MP camera up front and 16MP lenses on the back in both standard and Super Wide-Angle configurations for higher resolution photos with more details.\u00a0LG has further enhanced the AI features of the camera that first debuted in the LG V30S ThinQ. AI CAM now offers 19 shooting modes, up from eight, for even more intelligence-optimized shots. And users can improve their photos further by choosing among three other effect options if the one recommended by AI CAM doesn\u2019t suit their tastes. \u201cThe LG G7 ThinQ is strongly focused on the fundamentals and its launch marks a new chapter for our company,\u201d said Hwang Jeong-hwan, president of LG Electronics Mobile Communications Company. \u201cThrough the combination of personalized and useful AI functionalities with meaningful smartphone features, this is LG\u2019s most convenient smartphone yet.\u201d LG G7 ThinQ will be one of the first devices to get upcoming Google Lens features.\u00a0Google Lens is a new way to search using the latest in AI and computer vision. Available inside the Google Assistant and Google Photos, it can deliver more information on objects such as landmarks, plants, animals, books as well as identify text. Visit websites, add a business card to contacts, add events to the calendar or look up an item on a restaurant menu \u2013 all right from Google Lens. More details on Google Lens will be revealed at Google I/O. Located just below the volume is a button that launches the phone\u2019s AI functions. A single tap of this button will launch the Google Assistant while two quick taps will launch Google Lens, a first on any phone. Users can also hold down the button to start talking to the Google Assistant. The LG G7 ThinQ has a 6.1-inch QHD+ (3120 x 1440) display sporting a 19.5:9 FullVision screen ratio and a bottom bezel which is almost 50 percent slimmer than on the LG G6. Powered by LG\u2019s new LCD technology, Super Bright Display, the LG G7 ThinQ can be viewed easily even under direct sunlight with brightness up to an industry-leading 1,000 nit, displaying 100 percent DCI-P3 color gamut. The smartphone\u2019s New Second Screen gives users flexible options when it comes to setting up the display to fit their tastes and style. The display can be fully expanded for a bezel-less look or it can be set to a more traditional style where the notification bar is completely blacked out. Users can even change the notification bar to another color for a more personal effect.

Google also unveiled a new product that merges between virtual reality and calligraphy, as people around the world prepare to observe the holy month. Google users in different parts of the world will now be able to access all Ramadan related information right from the main Search results page by simply typing queries related to the holy month. The Search experience will house information like local prayer times, Ramadan tips, popular recipes on YouTube and links to Google&#8217;s main Ramadan services, the Qibla Finder and Qalam. Qalam (g.co/Qalam), a new web-application accessible through browsers which users can easily share with friends and family as their Ramadan and Eid greetings this year. Google worked with nine world-renowned artists and calligraphists to create over 35 artworks which merge between virtual reality art and calligraphy. Featured artists include the internationally renowned eL Seed whose designs incorporate calligraphy with graffiti (\u201ccalligraffiti\u201d), Tolga Girgin from Turkey who mixes calligraphy and typography and Soraya Syed, one of the first female calligraphers in Pakistan. The third update Google announced enables offline usage of the Qibla Finder (g.co/QiblaFinder), a web app launched last year that uses augmented reality on Android devices to identify the direction of the Qibla. The update also allows Android users to add a shortcut to Qibla Finder on their home screen. These updates are reflective of digital habits during Ramadan.

Last year, nearly one-third of cybercrime victims in the UAE fell for such scams, losing an average of 47.2 hours to resolve the issue. Furthermore, amongst those who have ever experienced a type of cybercrime, more than one in four (22 per cent) had their financial details compromised as a result of shopping online, 28 per cent experience credit or debit card fraud and 43 per cent were notified their personal or financial information was compromised in a data breach last year.E-commerce in the UAE is expected to be valued at $10 billion by 2018, according to Frost and Sullivan. It is a popular, fast, simple, and sometimes more affordable alternative for buying goods; in fact, nine out of 10 UAE consumers shop on-the-go on from their mobile devices according to Norton\u2019s research. This is despite the fact that 71 percent of the respondents in the country feel shopping from a mobile device is risky. In addition, UAE consumers have reported the following financial losses in the past year: Payment information stolen from their phone\u2013 AED 359 Credit/Debit card fraud \u2013 AED 3859 Financial information compromised due to shopping online \u2013 AED 381 UAE consumers lost more than two working days (18 hours) on average in dealing with credit or debit card fraud, while an average of one working day (eight hours) was lost trying to resolve or recover from an incident wherein their payment information was stolen from the phone. Consumers also spent an average of 22.4 hours (or nearly one working week) dealing with the consequences of financial information that was compromised while shopping online. In the UAE, millennials were the most affected by cybercrimes related to online shopping. While millennials are known for being a \u201cdigital-first\u201d generation and rather tech savvy, they also make similar mistakes such as using the same password across accounts and sharing their password with others. One in five millennials also admit to not having any protective measures in place for at least one of their devices. &#160; The post  Online shopping scams impacts million users in UAE  appeared first on  Review Central Middle East .", "language": "English", "source": "ReviewCentralMe", "link": "http://www.reviewcentralme.com/2018/05/11/online-shopping-scams-impacts-million-users-uae/", "date": "2018-05-11T03:38:53.000Z", "categories": "News ,Newsletter9 ,Security", "subject": "Online shopping scams impacts million users in UAE"}, {"body": "Amid a host of domestic development programs, a renewed effort to repair Russia\u2019s relations with the West may be on the cards The post  Putin comes out with a \u2018Russia First\u2019 strategy  appeared first on  Asia Times .", "language": "English", "source": "ATimes", "link": "http://www.atimes.com/article/putin-comes-out-with-a-russia-first-strategy/", "date": "2018-05-11T03:36:07.000Z", "categories": "Russia ,new policy ,Kremlin", "subject": "Putin comes out with a \u2018Russia First\u2019 strategy"}, {"body": "Moscow is content to maintain a balance between the two sides \u2013 leaving Iran\u2019s forces in Syria while allowing Israel to bomb them \u2013 as long as its achievement of saving the Assad regime is not endangered", "language": "English", "source": "Haaretz", "link": "https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-putin-gave-israel-free-hand-against-iran-but-he-may-have-to-pick-side-1.6075664", "date": "2018-05-11T03:13:03.000Z", "categories": "Russia ,Benjamin Netanyahu ,Vladimir Putin", "subject": "Putin is giving Israel a free hand against Iran in Syria.

The feature update, titled Lightsaber Versus Mode, is the second free update since the product launched last year. A first-of-its-kind, Star Wars: Jedi Challenges has allowed fans to train like a Jedi, battling against legendary dark side villains like Kylo Ren and Darth Vader in AR since its launch. Driven by overwhelming fan demand, the new multiplayer mode allows two players \u2013 each equipped with the smartphone-powered Lenovo Mirage AR headset, Lightsaber Controller, Tracking Beacon and a compatible smartphone \u2013 to face off in AR lightsaber battles, while in the same room. This is the first time two players can play simultaneously while being able to see the other player&#8217;s lightsaber in AR. \u201cInnovating and iterating based on customer feedback is a big part of what makes Lenovo products different and better,\u201d said Jeff Meredith, Senior Vice President and General Manager of Lenovo Consumer PCs and Smart Devices. \u201cOne of the most popular fan requests since the launch of Star Wars: Jedi Challenges is to enable 1-on-1 local multiplayer mode for fans to duel one another in lightsaber battles. We&#8217;re excited to continue collaborating with Disney to fulfill fans&#8217; wishes by testing the frontiers of augmented reality. The introduction of the Lightsaber Versus Mode is another step in our journey to offering consumers one-of-a-kind, immersive experiences made possible by AR.\u201d In Lightsaber Versus Mode, players are guided by visual cues indicating when and where to block, dodge, and strike. As players face off, the battle increases in difficulty until one player claims victory. Each player must download the latest version of the Star Wars: Jedi Challenges app on compatible smartphones, with access to the same Wi-Fi connection. \u201cOur goal here is to extend Star Wars experiences in completely new and different ways for fans &#8212; Star Wars: Jedi Challenges does exactly that,\u201d said Kyle Laughlin, Senior Vice President, Games and Interactive Experiences, Disney Parks, Experiences &#38; Consumer Products. \u201cThe product&#8217;s global success has encouraged us to give players even more authentic Star Wars moments, and we look forward to continuing to improve and expand the gameplay.\u201d Star Wars: Jedi Challenges is available at major retailers across UAE for AED 899 and the\u00a0app is also available for free to download on the App Store and Google Play. &#160; The post  Star Wars: Jedi Challenges with AR  appeared first on  Review Central Middle East .", "language": "English", "source": "ReviewCentralMe", "link": "http://www.reviewcentralme.com/2018/05/08/23201/", "date": "2018-05-08T14:09:09.000Z", "categories": "Apps ,Games ,AR", "subject": "Star Wars: Jedi Challenges with AR"}, {"body": "Israel has a major interest in Lebanon\u2019s stability \u2013 even with Hezbollah in the government.

The original lines for the design were drawn by Anders Hermansen in the \u201990s with a strong focus on making a set of earphones flexible enough to adapt to any ear. The adjustment system on the earphones lets you modify the angle of the earbud, the height of thepiston, and the curve of the earhook individually to ensure a perfect fit. Rotating and stretching in three different dimensions. An example of how expert engineering and design goes hand in hand to create an object that is as beautiful as it is useful.\u201cWe are extremely proud of our design heritage, and the original Earset has been a long-lasting favourite due to their flexible, yet precise industrial design and acoustic brilliance. We are excited to bring forward the new Earset that has been updated with wireless technology and a classic updated hue and satin\u201d, says B&#38;O PLAY Concept and Design Manager Jakob Kristoffersen. In the spirit of the Bang &#38; Olufsen legacy, Earset is crafted from premium materials made to last. The aluminium used for the telescopic piston has been precision-forged for fluid movement, ensuring a hydraulic-like feel. To deliver a comfortable and secure fit behind the ear, the iconic earhook has sections of soft rubber, and a hex screw attaches the piston to the hook, underlining the mechanical ideals that once inspired the original design.The anodization process of aluminium allows colours to be deeply integrated into the core of the material, providing more depth and durability, while the aluminium on the housing has a diamond cut-edge and a radially polished surface to catch and reflect light. The construction of the new Earset earphones has a different starting point than most models on the market. Rather than a deeper in-ear fit, Earset allows the speaker house to fit comfortably just inside the inner ear without blocking it. Apart from a more comfortable feel, this style allows ambient sounds to be heard while still maintaining the audio performance that you would expect from a set of B&#38;O PLAY earphones, says Bang &#38; Olufsen Executive Sound Engineer Knud-Erik Lauridsen, who also tuned the original Earset.The acoustics of the new earphones is built around a 14.2mm speaker unit with a neodymium magnet.

Over the whole quarter, the demand saw drop in January and February, before showing a significant quarterly rise of 40.9% in March. Anita Wang, senior research manager of WitsView, points out that LCD monitor market in 1Q18 has been more positive compared with 1Q17. Branded monitor makers were less motivated to ship products in 1Q17 due to the high prices of small size panels. In contrast, prices of LCD monitor panels appeared to be lower in the beginning of 2018, and then dropped further in March. The price drop has increased the profitability of companies, who have all become highly motivated in this quarter.Apart from prices, the growing demand for curved gaming monitors has been another growth momentum in the market. The curved gaming monitor market has been expanding rapidly since 2017 due to the products\u2019 high performance-price ratio and the popularity of video games. Nearly 40% of all the LCD gaming monitors are curved ones in 2017, and the figure is expected to reach 60% this year due to the high demand. This will further boost the annual shipments of gaming monitors to around 4 to 5 million units. Based on the remarkable shipment performance in 1Q18, WitsView forecasts that the annual decline of LCD monitor shipments in 2018 will be 0.4%, lower than previous forecast of above 2.5%. The market decline even has a chance to become positive growth if the brands\u2019 stocking up continues to boost the market.
