  "payload":"Whichever way you examine it, Marvel’s television output is a poor cousin. In cinemas, Marvel has perfected the blueprint for incredibly expensive, toweringly magisterial, high-sheen soapy fun. The same cannot be said for its small-screen fare. Netflix’s various Defenders off-shoots are dour and flabby. Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D has never been able to escape its reputation as connective tissue without connection. Inhumans was so dire that mankind appears to have already reached a tacit agreement to pretend that it never happened. New Warriors is lost in limbo without a network. The whole thing is disappointing and small-scale. With one exception. Legion. Noah Hawley’s extremely tangential X-Men spin-off finished its second series on FX last week in the US, and wraps up in the UK this coming Monday. By all accounts it’s a doozy. At least, I think it’s a doozy. It certainly looked very nice, and the performances were all terrific. As for what actually happened in it? That’s less clear."
