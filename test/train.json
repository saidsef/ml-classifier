    "1": "Whichever way you examine it, Marvel’s television output is a poor cousin. In cinemas, Marvel has perfected the blueprint for incredibly expensive, toweringly magisterial, high-sheen soapy fun. The same cannot be said for its small-screen fare. Netflix’s various Defenders off-shoots are dour and flabby. Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D has never been able to escape its reputation as connective tissue without connection. Inhumans was so dire that mankind appears to have already reached a tacit agreement to pretend that it never happened. New Warriors is lost in limbo without a network. The whole thing is disappointing and small-scale. With one exception. Legion. Noah Hawley’s extremely tangential X-Men spin-off finished its second series on FX last week in the US, and wraps up in the UK this coming Monday. By all accounts it’s a doozy. At least, I think it’s a doozy. It certainly looked very nice, and the performances were all terrific. As for what actually happened in it? That’s less clear.",
    "2": "LUCKNOW, India (Reuters) - India’s northern Uttar Pradesh state is demanding millions of rupees from over 200 people and threatening to confiscate their property as a penalty for damage done to public property during protests against the country’s new citizenship law. Uttar Pradesh, India’s most populous state, has suffered some of the most violent protests against India’s Citizenship Amendment Act, which gives minorities who have migrated from three neighboring countries a path to citizenship but doesn’t make the same concessions",
    "3": "Hong Kong riot police broke up a solidarity rally for China's Uighurs on Sunday – with one officer drawing a pistol – as the city's pro-democracy movement likened their plight to that of the oppressed Muslim minority. More than 1,000 people rallied peacefully in support of China's ethnic Uighurs, waving Uighur flags and posters in the city's financial district, marking the latest demonstration in over six months of anti-government unrest. A small group of protesters removed a Chinese flag from",
    "4": "The regional passport is a key element of the EAC's vision of free movement and free trade across the region. It will be used by citizens of the six EAC member countries (Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda, South Sudan, Tanzania and Uganda) where it will replace national passports. This flagship project to promote unity and trade between EAC members is already overdue, and compared to more ambitious plans, such as a common currency, it should be a relatively simple policy to roll",
    "5": "Tel Aviv: Israel’s defense minister on Saturday ordered a reduction of the fishing zone along the Gaza Strip’s coastline, in retaliation for clashes along the border fence with the Palestinian enclave. The fishing zone will be reduced to six nautical miles (11 kilometers) from nine nautical miles, a statement by Avigdor Lieberman’s office said. Restrictions on the extent of fishing zones along the Gaza shoreline form part of Israel’s economic blockade of the Strip, which has been in place for more than",
    "6": "Turkey is set to welcome over 30 ministers and more than 1,000 businesspeople from 49 African countries at the 2nd Turkey-Africa Economy and Business Forum in Istanbul. During the event, which will be held on Oct. 10-11, about 3,000 bilateral business meetings are expected, as well as the signing of new cooperation agreements. Organized by the Foreign Economic Relations Board (DEİK) and Turkey-Africa business councils under the auspices of President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan in cooperation with the Trade Ministry and the African",
    "7": "There is a crisis in Xinjiang. The details are murky. The Communist Party of China has little incentive to reveal the inner workings of the vast system of surveillance and terror it has built to control the 12 million Uighur and Kazakh citizens of China’s westernmost region. From the party’s perspective, the further away the global spotlight is from its activities the better. But we now have a rough outline of what is happening to the people of the region.",
    "8": "Istanbul, Turkey - In April 2017, Tarim, a 48-year-old businessman from Urumqi, the capital of China's Muslim Xinjiang region, received a phone call from the police summoning him to their offices in Aksu prefecture, 900km to the southwest. Tarim knew at once that he was in trouble and devised a getaway, keeping the details to himself. He had just a few hours to carry out his plan. Two days earlier, he was in Aksu for an attempt to rescue his sister Zohra",
    "9": "The scrupulously conservative UN has finally issued a report calling for the military leadership in Myanmar, including the Commander-in-Chief Min Aung Hlaing, to be investigated and prosecuted on charges of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes for the ‘clearance operations’ against the Rohingya in Rakhine state. International observers and NGOs have been trying to draw attention to Rakhine state for years, and many of us have been calling the situation of the Rohingya a ‘slow motion genocide’ for just",
    "10": "Ahed Tamimi, the 17-year-old Palestinian activist from the village of Nabi Saleh in the West Bank, is an icon of a rebellious young generation of Palestinians which has demonstrated it has little tolerance for Israel's persistent violations of their rights and freedoms. After spending eight months in jail for confronting Israeli occupation soldiers in her backyard, Ahed emerged even stronger and more determined to convey the pains and struggles of her people to the world.",
    "11": "Professor Tariq Ramadan's case and the solitary confinement he faces in a French prison sheds some light on the differentiated treatment Muslim subjects receive in the legal system of the Western states. In this article, I am not defending or making any arguments for the charges levied against professor Ramadan – they are serious and require full and fair examination by the authorities and the courts as well as more responsible coverage from the media.",
    "12": "NATO defence ministers held their first talks since US President Joe Biden took office, with the future of the organisation's 9,600-strong support mission in Afghanistan key on the agenda. NATO defence ministers looked to reinvigorate ties on Wednesday as they held their first talks since US President Joe Biden took office after four years of tensions under Donald Trump."
